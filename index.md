  - excerpt: >
     The 15th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2026) 
  is organized and sponsored by SIGLEX, the Special Interest Group of the ACL, 
  and will be colocated with [ACL 2026](https://acl2026.org). 
  *SEM brings together researchers interested in the semantics of natural languages 
  and its computational modeling. The conference embraces data-driven, neural, 
  and probabilistic approaches, as well as symbolic approaches and everything in between; 
  practical applications as well as theoretical contributions are welcome. 
  The long-term goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the growing number 
  of NLP researchers working on all aspects of semantics of (many and diverse!) 
  natural languages.
